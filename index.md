Hello!

![A picture of Wojciech Rzadkowski](/images/thumb_picture.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

My name is Wojciech RzÄ…dkowski. 

Currently I am a PhD Researcher at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](http://ist.ac.at). I am part of the [Lemeshko Group](http://lemeshko.pages.ist.ac.at). My current scope of work concerns both analytic and numerical approaches to impurity problems with special focus on the recently theorized [angulon quasiparticle](https://physicsworld.com/a/meet-the-angulon-a-new-quasiparticle-found-in-superfluid-helium/).

The best way to contact me is by email: wojciech.rzadkowski _at_ ist.ac.at
